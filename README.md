Angular example with usage of https://github.com/zendesk/cross-storage. Start first application on port 3000 and second on default 4200 then set local storage item on both apps and check what is logged in console and displayed in view. View should show only local storage item for current domain but cross-domain implementation should log out value from another domain. It is as easy implementation as possible to show that it can be done in less than 1 hour;
